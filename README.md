Create grid squares using JavaScript, not HTML
Put grid sqaures in another container
Make divs appaer as a grid using float/clear, inline-block, or flexbox
Margins and borders can adjust square size

Set up a hover effect so that the grid divs change color when the mouse passes over them. Or have it when the mouse clicks the square.
    - Set up listener
    - To change color, add a new class to the div, or change the div's bg color using JS

Ask the user for a number of squares per side for the new grid
